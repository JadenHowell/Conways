This is my first attempt to make something useful with a GUI. 
The idea was from some guy on youtube, who showed how to draw basic graphics onto a panel. 
I'm trying to additionaly find out how to add tracking data and such to the code, with hopes of using this experience to make a natural selection simulation. 
As of first commit, base logic for conway's was done, just need to finilize a couple things, then add the lower panel implementation.
